<H1>Rationale for Bridgewater X Metaculus</H1>
<P>I've been reading a lot about forecasting lately, so when I saw
 on ACX that the forecasting platform Metaculus had partnered with 
 the hedge fund Bridgewater to put on a forecasting tournament, I 
 decided to throw my hat in the ring. Having made my forecasts, I 
thought it would be interesting and productive to try to explain my
rationale for each prediction, question by question. I should note that
I'm a complete amateur, and my relevant domain knowledge is pretty much
nonexistent for every single question so far. But my hope is that
forcing myself to explain my answers will lead me to more reasoned
predictions and gain some insight into my own internal processes
for forecasting and reasoning in general.</P>
