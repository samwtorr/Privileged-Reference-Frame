<H1>Rationale for Bridgewater X Metaculus</H1>
<P><A href="index.html">Return to Homepage</A></P>
<P>I've been reading a lot about forecasting lately, so when I saw
 on ACX that the forecasting platform Metaculus had partnered with 
 the hedge fund Bridgewater to put on a forecasting tournament, I 
 decided to throw my hat in the ring. Having made my forecasts, I 
thought it would be interesting and productive to try to explain my
rationale for each prediction, question by question. I should note that
I'm a complete amateur, and my relevant domain knowledge is pretty much
nonexistent for every single question so far. But my hope is that
forcing myself to explain my answers will lead me to more reasoned
predictions and gain some insight into my own internal processes
for forecasting and reasoning in general.</P>
<UL>
<LI><b>Question 1: Will OpenAI release a new ChatGPT generation 
    before May 16, 2024?</b>
    <P>4%. I did a minimal amount of research. There's a rumor floating
    around based on a screenshot of a potential leak indicating that
    the next GPT version would have a knowledge cutoff date in June, 
    which would obviously mean that the version couldn't be released 
    by May, but that screenshot has very questionable validity. 
    From a quick look at OpenAI's release cadence and internet 
    expectations, (reddit, manifold) this seems highly unlikely.<P>
<LI><b>Question 2: Will Israel and Hamas reach a ceasefire deal before May 16, 2024?</b>
    <P>6%. I think I'm probably a bit extreme about this. It
    certainly seems unlikely that either side will reach a deal right
    now, but a month feels like a long time in this kind of thing. My
    initial thinking was that Iran's escalated involvement would make
    this even more unlikely, but a commenter in the tournament expressed
    the opinion that if anything it will actually increase the pressures
    felt by both sides to come to a ceasefire. I'm not so sure I agree with
    that, but it does cause me to question my certainty about my original
    assumption.<P>
<LI><b>Question 3: Will NVIDIA's stock price close above $950 on any single day before May 21, 2024?</b>
    <P>45%. My reasoning for this was very straightforward, and probably stupid:
    I don't think I can beat the stock market. If I had any clue which way
    individual stocks would trend, I'd be an investor, but I don't and I'm not.
    My only explanation for less than 50% is that the stock is currently trading 
    under $900, and based off of my eyeball test of the stock's average volatility,
    I thought it slightly more likely to never reach $950.<P>
<LI><b>Question 4: What will be the value of Bitcoin (in USD) on May 15, 2024?</b>
    <P>63.0k (58.3k - 68.1k). This is just based on the community
    prediction, tempered very slightly by my irrational bias against crypto.<P>
<LI><b>Question 5: How many tornadoes will there be in the US in April 2024?</b>
    <P>223 (200 - 244). This question felt relatively easy for me. Based on the
    preliminary reporting it seems like we're on track for a minimum of 200 tornados
    in April (we're already at > 150) and the general average in April is 220. I didn't
    do the math obviously, but I'd expect this forecast is closer to "optimal" than most
    of my others.<P>
<LI><b>Question 6: Will the Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes domestic opening box office set a new franchise record?</b>
    <P>6%. I think I'll likely change this soon. This feels targeted at my bias as
    a wannabe coastal elite/pretentious douche. I think this movie looks terrible, 
    and I say that as someone who enjoyed the 2010s trilogy. The director looks bad,
    the writer looks bad, and I just don't expect it to be very good or to generate much
    hype from consumers. That being said, the latest Godzilla v Kong movie somehow made > $80M
    like two weeks ago, and I wouldn't have expected anyone to go see that movie, so
    I'm clearly not well calibrated on the genpop's blockbuster action movie tastes.<P>
<LI><b>Question 7: Will an interest rate cut below current levels occur or increase in likelihood for June following the May 1, 2024 Federal Open Market Committee meeting?</b>
    <P>48%. This question sucks. As a commenter said, I'd expect it to be 50/50 if the
    linked tool that the question is based on is accurate. I'm also much more confident
    that the tool is accurate than that I'm accurate. It seems clear that there won't be
    a rate cut in May, but I have no clue if it will increase in likelihood for June.
    I originally put like 5% or something, but that was when I misunderstood the question.<P>
<LI><b>Question 8: Will SpaceX's fourth Starship integrated flight test reach an altitude of at least 200 kilometers before May 20, 2024?</b>
    <P>63%. The three factors I'm considering are how likely it is that the ship actually launches,
    how likely it is that the ship doesn't blow up or whatever rockets do, and how likely
    it is that the ship hits the altitude even if the flight goes perfectly. I found
    odds for the first question on Manifold at roughly 75%. My estimates for the other two
    are somewhere around 90-95%, so I just hit a rough guess of 63%.<P>
<LI><b>Question 9: Will a version of Claude be the top model on chat.lmsys.org leaderboard on May 16, 2024?</b>
    <P>45%. I truly do not know. It seems like Claude Opus is *probably* the best LLM currently, and it also
    seems unlikely that any other LLMs will be released in the next month that unseat it, but GPT4 is still
    neck-and-neck with it as of writing. Big shrug on this one.<P>
<LI><b>Question 10: Will Joe Biden issue his 11th veto before May 17, 2024?</b>
    <P>65%. I had this at 15% until I checked this question to write this, and saw a commenter
    linking to a reuters article about a bill that was passed that Biden vowed to
    veto back in January. There's like no press following this action, but
    I'm not really confident at all anymore. I don't know how common it is for presidents
    to not veto something that they said they would, but my initial thinking on the matter
    was premised on pretty crucial congressional compromise ongoing over Ukraine/Israel aid,
    which I'd assumed Biden wouldn't want to mess with. Which still stands. But my intuition
    is that it seems more likely than not that he'd veto something he promised to veto.<P>
