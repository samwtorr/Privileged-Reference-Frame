<P>Here's my gameplan for this: briefly summarize the plot to refresh my mind on what all happened, and
    try to explain how specific scenes and chapters made me feel. Then at the end I want to try to get 
    at the heart of how I felt about the book as a whole.</P>
<P>So let's jump in. The book follows "The Kid", opening with a quick series of sketches of his life: orphaned,
    drifting around getting into fights, and making absolutely no friends, all before the age of 14. He ends up in Texas, where he first encounters
    the Judge. Our introduction to the Judge is a scene in which he incites a riot against a local tent preacher by
    making up perverse tales about the preacher. The Kid then gets in a fight with a man named Toadvine, before both 
    the Kid and Toadvine are knocked out by a third party. When they wake up, they join forces and kill someone before 
    burning down the hotel they were staying at and riding off. To be honest, it wasn't clear to me why any of this 
    happened. I <i>think</i> you can assume that the Kid and Toadvine were killing the man who intervened in their fight,
    and that maybe the hotel burning down was just incidental. I'm not sure it matters. But it seems that at this point the Kid has been
    set on some unavoidable course.</P>
<P>From this point, the Kid wanders a bit, separates from Toadvine, and is eventually recruited by a group of men who are upset at the end
    of the Mexican American war and are still fighting about something. He travels with this group south into Mexico, but he's not with them for long 
    before they're attacked and completely routed by Comanches. The destruction of the group is terrifyingly rendered - 
    the attack of the comanches seems like some force of nature or onslaught of Lovecraftian horror. It's an incredibly compelling passage, both
    beautiful and horrible. The kid manages to escape and wanders around the desert for a
    few days, before he's eventually picked up and jailed. He finds Toadvine in the jail again, who manages to bail them out of jail to join an outfit 
    of scalp hunters. The Judge is a lieutenant in this group of scalp hunters (which the Kid and Toadvine kind of just accept), but it's led by a man named Glanton.
