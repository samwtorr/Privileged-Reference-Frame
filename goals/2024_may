<H1>May 2024 Goals</H1>
<H3>Return to Form Arc</H3>
<P><A href="index.html">Return to Homepage</A></P>
<P>I want to do a better job of setting, achieving, tracking, and evaluating goals.
    Posting my goals here is a good way to set them. Obviously I'll try to follow the 
    typical advice: specific, time-limited, achievable, measurable, etc. While I'm hoping that
    by writing them down I'll be making an important first step towards achieving them, there's 
    a few other ideas I have about how to follow through more consistently. The first is 
    just to find ways to keep the goal top of mind- I don't want it to get lost in the 
    shuffle of whatever new hobby of the month I'm interested in. Secondly, I want to do a 
    better job of planning my days in advance, particularly when there's a break in my routine
    such as travelling. I need to have a good plan of attack to make sure that I'm still working 
    towards achieving my goals while I'm out of my routine, or at the very least find ways
    to get back into my routine as quickly as possible. As for tracking and evaluating, I'm 
    once again hoping to rely on this site - I'll just need to make sure I'm consistent 
    in posting here, which is a goal in and of itself of course.

<H3>Goal 1: Weigh in at 155 lbs. by end of May</H3>
<P>
    The goal I want to set today (May 1st) is about gaining weight for the purposes
    of body-building. I was making sporadic progress earlier this year, but faced 
    a major setback when I ended up with a stomach flu. That's partially why I'm 
    titling this as my return to form arc. There's a couple nuances to this goal that 
    are worth thinking about. Firstly, the point of the goal is really to build muscle, 
    not to gain weight. Bumping up the weight on the scale is really just a proxy to 
    ensure that I'm eating adequately for my training. I've been plateued at my current 
    general physique and strength for far too long, and I want to make some significant gains
    again. Secondly, weight fluctuates throughout the day, and it's not necessarily clear 
    what it means to actually weigh a specific amount, except maybe as sort of an average. 
    So the goal is just to weigh in at any point this month at 155 lbs, with the idea being
    that if I can achieve that it will represent "statistically significant" weight gain, 
    for lack of a better term.

    The way I see it, this goal is really about finding ways to eat on weekends, particularly 
    weekends where my eidolon is in town or when I'm out of town. This has been the real 
    challenge for me in the past when it comes to this, because I actually do manage to eat a lot 
    when I have both time and access to foods I like. When the eidolon is in town, it's just going 
    to be a battle of making myself an extra meal each day - this feels very achievable, and it's 
    something she can probably help me with. Travelling is harder, but I expect that it'll come down to 
    a combination of buying more ready-made food that I can eat on the go (e.g. protein bars) and 
    focusing on eating bigger portions/more food at restauraunts. I think the general conclusion with 
    this one is that I'll have to spend a bit more money than my homeostasis instincts. This should be fine 
    though, because the amount extra I'll need to spend should still be relatively small. It just takes 
    more preparation, which is why I think it's helpful to be writing about this now. Maybe tomorrow I'll 
    order some RX bars or something. Aside from that, this goal is really just about consistency. Which I 
    suspect will be true of all of my goals. More to come.
